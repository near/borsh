// TODO: Replace errors

/// A trait for objects which are byte-oriented sinks.
///
/// Implementors of the `Write` trait are sometimes called 'writers'.
///
/// Writers are defined by two required methods, [`write`] and [`flush`]:
///
/// * The [`write`] method will attempt to write some data into the object,
///   returning how many bytes were successfully written.
///
/// * The [`flush`] method is useful for adaptors and explicit buffers
///   themselves for ensuring that all buffered data has been pushed out to the
///   'true sink'.
///
/// Writers are intended to be composable with one another. Many implementors
/// throughout [`std::io`] take and provide types which implement the `Write`
/// trait.
///
/// [`write`]: Write::write
/// [`flush`]: Write::flush
/// [`std::io`]: self
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```no_run
/// use std::io::prelude::*;
/// use std::fs::File;
///
/// fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
///     let data = b"some bytes";
///
///     let mut pos = 0;
///     let mut buffer = File::create("foo.txt")?;
///
///     while pos < data.len() {
///         let bytes_written = buffer.write(&data[pos..])?;
///         pos += bytes_written;
///     }
///     Ok(())
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The trait also provides convenience methods like [`write_all`], which calls
/// `write` in a loop until its entire input has been written.
///
/// [`write_all`]: Write::write_all
pub trait Write {
    /// Write a buffer into this writer, returning how many bytes were written.
    ///
    /// This function will attempt to write the entire contents of `buf`, but
    /// the entire write may not succeed, or the write may also generate an
    /// error. A call to `write` represents *at most one* attempt to write to
    /// any wrapped object.
    ///
    /// Calls to `write` are not guaranteed to block waiting for data to be
    /// written, and a write which would otherwise block can be indicated through
    /// an [`Err`] variant.
    ///
    /// If the return value is [`Ok(n)`] then it must be guaranteed that
    /// `n <= buf.len()`. A return value of `0` typically means that the
    /// underlying object is no longer able to accept bytes and will likely not
    /// be able to in the future as well, or that the buffer provided is empty.
    ///
    /// # Errors
    ///
    /// Each call to `write` may generate an I/O error indicating that the
    /// operation could not be completed. If an error is returned then no bytes
    /// in the buffer were written to this writer.
    ///
    /// It is **not** considered an error if the entire buffer could not be
    /// written to this writer.
    ///
    /// An error of the [`ErrorKind::Interrupted`] kind is non-fatal and the
    /// write operation should be retried if there is nothing else to do.
    ///
    /// # Examples
    ///

    /// use std::io::prelude::*;
    /// use std::fs::File;
    ///
    /// fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    ///     let mut buffer = File::create("foo.txt")?;
